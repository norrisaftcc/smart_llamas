# llama food

### nice and pre-cut 
ok data that's been vetted for:
- conformance with our organization's security policy (no student names, etc.)
- is converted to Markdown probably
- chunked into reasonable pieces (probably with internal tags)

will get fed to Gemma. We'll keep that material here for our next llama, as well as to help understand the process of SMART in general.

***Questions in Response to Above***
Can you provide at minimum, a guideline on policy and acceptable and not acceptable content?
Could our provide as an advancement, a tool that I could say, drop my file into a folder and it process a (?)script(?) to clean and reformat to preferred file type? Can you automate the process for "clean and chop" food/data preperations?

Elaborate details for "probably with internal tags" my limited experience I only know that tags could apply to programming/various different coding languages. If you provide some context for usage here, it will better inform my prompts (at least for basics, I've learned I can sort of code without any practical skill by successfully prompting for type/format needed and testing/troubleshooting)
I will provide the unooked food - can you provide the food processor?
