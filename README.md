Can you put ðŸŽ“ðŸ¦™ here yes, good, GitHub is cool with Unicode. (Of course it is, but never hurts to prove it.)

# What is this?
it's a minimum viable product that I hope will be useful to cool people I hang out with.
I would like to scale this up -- but that's a good start I think.
It's also ProfFisherJenn's CSC 113 semester project for 25SP.

# Smart Llamas MVP - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

## Overview

Welcome to the Smart Llamas MVP repository! This project aims to integrate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a Large Language Model (LLM) to create a powerful and efficient information retrieval and generation solution. This MVP focuses on leveraging vector stores to enhance the capabilities of LLMs for better, context-aware responses.

## Features

- **Document Preprocessing**: Automatically splits and processes documents for efficient handling.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Utilizes state-of-the-art models to generate vector embeddings for text.
- **Vector Store Integration**: Easily store and query document vectors using FAISS.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Quickly retrieve relevant document chunks based on user queries.
- **LLM Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Large Language Models to generate informative responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries

# More thoughts

I work in semi-sorted Markdown files, so I think back and forth conversion between those and, say, Word, might be a priority.
Alternative: automate the process, which is doable but not top priority.

The Project is generally a "Kanban board" which in Japanese means "board" so it's a board board.
Kanban was brought over from Japanese automotive and engineering firms in the 1980s. I think it's self-explanatory -- add items, determine which to do first, move them across the board.

# Staff
Currently:
- norrisaftcc: Dev Lead and Project Manager (I would just dev, but I need to work on my skills.)
- ProfFisherJenn: QA and on-site customer (two very different hats, but a good mix.)
