Can you put ðŸŽ“ðŸ¦™ here yes, good, GitHub is cool with Unicode. (Of course it is, but never hurts to prove it.)

# What is this?
it's a minimum viable product that I hope will be useful to cool people I hang out with.
I would like to scale this up -- but that's a good start I think.

# Smart Llamas MVP - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

## Overview

Welcome to the Smart Llamas MVP repository! This project aims to integrate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a Large Language Model (LLM) to create a powerful and efficient information retrieval and generation solution. This MVP focuses on leveraging vector stores to enhance the capabilities of LLMs for better, context-aware responses.

## Features

- **Document Preprocessing**: Automatically splits and processes documents for efficient handling.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Utilizes state-of-the-art models to generate vector embeddings for text.
- **Vector Store Integration**: Easily store and query document vectors using FAISS.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Quickly retrieve relevant document chunks based on user queries.
- **LLM Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Large Language Models to generate informative responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries
